Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Is an access management service that controls who can have access to what in your AWS Account.


IAM User Management Aspects:

1. Passwords
2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
3. Access Keys
4. SSH Keys


PRO Tip: We should enable the MFA to our AWS Account for added security.


IAM Policy:
Policy -> Permission -> Resource Permission -> Service Permission


IAM Policy Examples:

1. Developer Group Policy
	- EC2 Full Access

2. Tester Group Policy
	- DynamoDB Read-Only
	- S3 Full Access


It is also advisable that we dont use our root account to access different AWS Services.

We should create a new "User" that has a corresponding policy attached to it. Or much better, we create a "Group" and, add the newly created "User" to that "Group".

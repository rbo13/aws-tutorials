Relational Database Service (RDS)

Relational DB:
	- Efficient data transfer and storage.
	- Strict Record Schema
	- Easy Querying
	- Has Query Flexibility

When you create an RDS instance in AWS, it creates an EC2 Instance under the hood.

RDS also has a read replica, this is essentially a copy of your database that is not being used in production. It is done with eventual consistencies. Read replica will not be used as a failover, since it is not used in production.

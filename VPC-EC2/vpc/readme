Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)


VPC:
- Allows developer to create a virtual network.


Important tool/s in a VPC:

1. Security Group
		- Defines allowed incoming/outgoing IP addresses and ports. Kind of like a mini firewall.
		- It is attached to the instance level, and can be shared among many instances.

2. Routing Table
3. Network Access Control List (Network ACLs)

Creating a Subnet with a following CIDR Block (10.0.0.0/24) can have an IP Address range of: (10.0.0.0) to (10.0.0.255)


When creating a new Subnet:

1. Select the VPC you want the subnet to run on.
2. Select a different Availability Zone.
3. For the CIDR block, it must be different from the first you've created. So the values should be:

CIDR Block      IP Addresses
10.0.1.0/24  => 10.0.1.0 to 10.0.1.255
